# Seamount-Biotrap-OTU-analysis-
This is a project to analyze OTUs from sequences of zetaproteobacteria.

Introduction:
Zetaproteobacteria are iron-oxidizing bacteria that can use iron to obtain energy. Not only that, but they are also capable of doing so in different environments (both the deep ocean and estuaries)! They are only a recently described bacteria sublcass, and therefore there is still much we do not know about their growth and biogeographic patterns. This study deals with understanding the composition of artificial growth chamber set up near hydrothermal vents, where they were originally found. I have some genetic data (OTU data), which tells us the genetic similarity between these bacteria (very similar to species), as well as different environmental measurments.

My objectives are to:

Observe if there are differences between OTUs between two sites: Axial and Loihi

Use this project to apply the work to my thesis by analyzing what environmental factors influence how these bacteria are organized.
